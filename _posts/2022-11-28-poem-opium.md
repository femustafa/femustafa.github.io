Work and pray, do not dismay
The truth is here to stay
But they also have something to say

How could you be so dumb?
You use religion to make your pain numb
You will get a pie in the sky when you die
It's just another lie
It will be dope, let's redefine the scope
Believe me, it's not a joke
Opium, caffeine, and other friends of cheap dopamine
They are the real hope

Work, pray and play
But remember, there is an end to this clay
Let's not get high
There is more to life than just ingrate cry
