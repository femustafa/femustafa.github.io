**Condition:** Trails and Tribulations

**Response:** Patience

Probably astronomy is to blame\
Our stars are on the flame\
Horrified by the fault in our stars\
Even tea-leaf-readers threw out \
leaves and the jars 

Don't be silly, nothing is willy-nilly\
You see that bright star?\
Even it is at the mercy of a dark and wicked tsar\ 
Night with all its might, makes the star bright\
No wonder, its brightness is blessing of inevitable plight 

Mary was a women, pious and chaste\
Why do you think, her suffering was a waste?\
Daughters of eve find relief, comparing their sorrow with her grief\
No wonder, Quran honor her as a women of highest belief
