**Condition:** Disobediance

**Response:** Repentence 

You said, love is sacred and pristine \
How could you then fall for forgetful irene ? 

She forgets, then forgets she has forgotten \
You, your memories are the leaves that will be rotten

Sad, you don't get what you desire\
Bad, you are stuck in a quagmire\
Be careful for what you wish for\
What if? you finally get what you aspire\ 
Tragedy of tragedies, the ultimate quagmire 

Sinner, thats who you are\ 
Winner, thats what you were destined for\
Stop missing the mark\ 
Your future will no more be dark\
Repent, maybe thats the new journey you should embark\
You want inner of a beginner? \
Why not then repent like a winner? 

Keep knocking, it's the demand \
Keep walking, it's the command \
Knowledge, humility and repentence ability\
Any better way to avoid detention and remand?
